# Section IV Part G: Creating Location and Container Records, and Location and Container Profiles

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

[Throughout: remember to also explain how to spawn records from other records and how to link records to each other]

*[also note use of container records in physical instances; link to archival objects subsection.  (and possibly note that accessions and top-level resources can have container instances, but that we prefer to attach/link them to archival objects instead, if possible.)]*

*[re: importing / exporting / linking top containers: from Sarit Hand listserv email of 3.04.2024: "See [this section](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/pages/890339531/Importing*and*Exporting*Data__;Kysr!!PvDODwlR4mBZyAb0!SFTUyLpIthrto6SIgDZ8UPFpCn1cBSEq3qwGTF89b0mp1X0LWlpL7kPFxzyUtKtkhGdo25pvHVWO3cH3xpDzQEqiuFi3v6Pe9w$) in the Guide. The Importing Top containers via spreadsheet allows creating, linking top containers along with linking to pre-existing locations. I have found, it is a matter of mapping out the workflow in deciding how to approach this part of the process. Thus far, I upload bulk importers of archival objects and create the top containers there. We donâ€™t typically have pre-existing top containers for records I bulk import. Then I use the Manage Top Containers module to bulk update container profiles and locations. I find it easier than searching for IDs and transposing them to yet another spreadsheet. I also can better manage profiles if/when I have a collection with a variety of container profiles and/or location of which I have many."]*
