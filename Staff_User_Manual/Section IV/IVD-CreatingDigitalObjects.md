# Section IV Part D: Creating Digital Object Records

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

[Throughout: remember to also explain how to spawn records from other records and how to link records to each other]

1. user preference setting and/or policy decision (i.e. whether to make a global default): Spawn digital object description from linked record? (default preferences setting; users can also choose for themselves); probably best to set as allowed; this will let users re-use description from a linked archival object with less friction.
