# Section IV Part A: Creating Accession Records

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

*[Throughout: remember to also explain how to spawn records from other records and how to link records to each other.  Also remember to link to the relevant section(s) of the ASpace Help Center's User Manual.]*

## Overview

**Purpose**: To record information about new archival materials, whether distinct collections or accruals to existing collections.  

**Who creates, and when**: Anyone who needs to document the accessioning of archival material, either at the time the materials are received or after the fact.

**To Create a New Record**:

1. First, make sure that your accession has a unique identifier by making sure it isn't already in the master list: [UHM Library Archival Collections](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VD_ShYlU-m_fzbAzrUhigjBtcp-6xGua1GxQFoEFm9s) in Google Sheets
    1. If it's a *new acquisition*
       1. Ask the registrar--as of Fall 2024, Leilani Dawson--to assign an accession number to your acquisition.
       2. Go to ASpace when you have the accession number.
    2. If it's a *pre-existing accession* (that for some reason wasn't ever recorded in ASpace) *but you don’t know the accession number*
       1. Ask the registrar to check to see if it already has an accession number
       2. In your request, make sure to note what you know about the accession, especially any details you may have about its title, creator, donor, the dates and formats of materials, and the year of donation.
       3. Go to ASpace when you have the accession number.
    3. If it’s a *pre-existing accession* (that for some reason wasn't ever recorded in ASpace) *and you know the accession number*
       1. You can go directly to ASpace.
2. Then, in ASpace
   1. Under the 'Create' menu, choose 'Accession'.
   2. Enter at least the 'Minimum Fields for Good Practice' (see below).
   3. (Optional): Add any 'Desirable' and/or 'Optional' fields (see below) if/as wished.
3. As you are working: Save throughout the process to ensure you don't lose data.
4. When finished: Make sure the 'Publish?' checkbox is left un-checked.  (We don't publish accession records.)

## Fields in Accession Records

### Minimum Fields for Good Practice

ArchivesSpace only requires the ‘Identifier’ and ‘Accession Date’ fields, but also fill out the ‘Title’, ‘Provenance’, ‘Acquisition Type’, and ‘Resource Type’ fields; plus the fields pertaining to restrictions if they apply.

1. **Basic Info > Title**
   1. Give the title of the accession, usually in the form of ‘Creator Name’ + ‘Resource Type’ (see instructions at link for ‘Resource Type’ options).
      1. If an accession is almost entirely made up of only one or two forms of material, use those form(s) in the title, e.g. 'Masao Sakagami Photographs' instead of the broader 'Masao Sakagami Papers'.
      2. See the description of the 'Title' field on the Resource Record page *[add link]* for more details and examples.
   2. If an accession is an accrual, it is very helpful to add the accession number to the title; otherwise, when linking accessions to either each other or to resource records, all the accessions in the search/browse lists for a single collection end up listed as 'So and So papers', with nothing to distinguish them from each other.
2. **Basic Info > Identifier**
   1. In the first box, enter the acquisition’s accession number.  Don't split the parts of the number into different boxes.  
      1. (I.e. the department code if present, the accession year, and the numeric sequence should all go into the first box.)
      2. NOTE: This is NOT standard practice! Most institutions put each section of an accession number into its own separate box, but at this point it would take a fairly significant change to switch everything.
3. **Basic Info > Accession Date**
   1. The field defaults to the current date.  
      1. If the materials were accessioned earlier than their being logged into ArchivesSpace, then replace the default date with the actual date that they were accessioned.
4. **Basic Info > Provenance**
   1. Enter a brief description of how the accession came into the library's possession.
      1. E.g. "Purchased from [X] with [Y] funds" or "Donated by [Creator]'s daughter, [Donor]".
   2. (The field can also be used for longer/more complicated chain of custody information, but this isn’t required.)
5. **Basic Info > Acquisition Type**
6. **Basic Info > Resource Type**
7. **Basic Info > Access and/or Use Restrictions Fields**

### Desirable Fields

1. **Basic Info > Content Description**
2. **Basic Info > Condition Description**
3. **Dates** (General Usage Note)
   1. **Dates > Label**
   2. **Dates > Type**
   3. **Dates > Expression, Begin, and End Fields**
4. **Extents** (General Usage Note)
   1. **Extents > Portion**
   2. **Extents > Number and Type**
   3. **Extents > Container Summary**
5. **Agent Links**

### Optional Fields

*Note re: Optional Fields*: All fields not either listed above in the 'Good Practice' and 'Desirable' sections or listed below in the 'Do Not Use' section are optional.  Add them if you feel like it, or if you particularly need to track the location(s) of the material you're accessioning.

1. With the exception of the 'Instances' section, most should be fairly self-explanatory.
2. If not, read the tool tips, look at the relevant section(s) of the User Manual in the ASpace Help Center *[add link]*, or ask Leilani for guidance.

### Do Not Use These Fields
