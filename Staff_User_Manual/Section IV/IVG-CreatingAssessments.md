# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

[Throughout: remember to also explain how to spawn records from other records and how to link records to each other.  Also, since this is a module we haven't used much--if at all--before, remember to add overview / purpose / who creates / why information.]

Notes from earlier video re: assessments, viewed 2018.10.18:

- [NB: Module requires specific user/group permissions.]
- Useful to expose hidden collections, establish priorities (for processing, digitization, remedial description/metadata cleanup, preservation, etc.)
- Allows for more + better collection management (and access)
- Can be linked to: accessions, resources, components (AOs), or DOs.
  - Can be viewed in browse mode or directly from linked record
  - Can be created either directly or from inside the linked record
- Steps:
  - scope the survey
  - do the survey
  - use descriptive data to create baseline record[s] for everything
  - analyze data and plan future project(s)
- things you can survey:
  - targeted portions of the collection, e.g.: various backlogs, new accessions (i.e. unprocessed material), under processed collections, under described collections)
  - everything (i.e. a holistic survey to serve as a comprehensive baseline)
- Assessment form / record includes ratings (e.g. documentation, housing, interest/value, condition, intellectual and physical access, reformatting readiness, etc.) and check boxes (e.g. lists of: format types, conservation issues, types of existing description, etc.).
- The survey form can be modified, e.g. to add checkboxes for under/over-filled boxes, rolled materials, presence of frass (or other evidence of pests), etc.
