- The SUI now allows users to determine various aspects of the program's look, feel, and behavior.  These include (but are not limited to):
  - Whether or not suppressed records are displayed
  - Whether or not newly-created records are pre-populated with other defaults or if they are always completely blank
  - What columns appear--and the order in which they appear--when searching or browsing
  - The default note order in resources, archival objects, and digital objects
- As of 8/2024, the defaults for the UHML repository can be found [on GitHub here](https://github.com/UnivHI-MLib-Arch/ASpace-Docs/blob/StaffMan-UpgradeHist/Staff_User_Manual/UHML-ASpaceSUI-RepositoryDefaults.docx)
  - Users can override/change these defaults by opening on the drop-down menu by their user name in the upper right hand corner of the screen and clicking on "Repository Preferences (username)".
