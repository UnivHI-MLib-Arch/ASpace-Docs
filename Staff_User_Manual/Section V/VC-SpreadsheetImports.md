# Section V Part C: Uploading Data via Spreadsheet Imports

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

*[recap of 'best for' section from overview, then specific instructions. Also remember to link to the relevant section(s) of the ASpace Help Center's User Manual. (which is probably [this page](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/pages/1173913646/Import+Archival+Objects+from+Excel+or+CSV+File+from+v2.8.1) but double check.)]*

*[remember when giving instructions / advice for uploading data via spreadsheet: let people know which template to use, give caveat re: Excel playing fast and loose with dates/numbers, and also caveat on the amount of time it takes background jobs to run]*

*["As of ArchivesSpace v3.2, all bulk import templates can be download via the gear menu in the ArchivesSpace staff user interface.  Select Bulk Import Templates from the drop down."]*

*[1. some tips for spreadsheet uploads: use xlsx for initial data entry (for data validation and overall better guidance), but the copy-paste into csv and use csv rather than xlsx upload [or else do xyz steps to ensure excel doesn't botch the dates and ruin the upload]; 2. keep number of rows under 1000. 3-x.â€¦etc.]*
