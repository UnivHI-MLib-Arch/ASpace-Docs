# Section I Part A: Introduction

## Purpose

*[This would probably be a good place to also include links to the SUI and PUI...but maybe put that info in the Scope section below instead ...]*

## Audience

*[UHML staff, students, volunteers, etc. who work with ArchivesSpace]*

## Scope

  1. This manual covers the ArchivesSpace [ASpace] Staff User Interface [SUI]
    - and in particular how/where local practice at UHML differs from common ASpace usage
    - (see the 'other resources' section for standard practice) *[link to the section]*
  2. This manual does **not** cover the Public User Interface [PUI], or the backend databases (i.e. solr for the search index and MySQL for the underlying data)
    - *[include link(s) to where to go for help on PUI (for researchers and/or staff users of the PUI)]*
  3. *[How to use this guide....]*

## Credits

*[mention earlier versions; also acknowledge Yale's guide & cross-link to Section II]*
