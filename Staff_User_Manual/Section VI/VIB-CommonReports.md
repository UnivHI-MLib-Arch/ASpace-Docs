# Section VI Part B: Common Reports

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

*[...remember to note that running reports and other background jobs can take a long time (like 10 minutes, in some cases) and also that the interface gives very little feedback while the background job is processing. .... Also remember to link to the relevant section(s) of the ASpace Help Center's User Manual.]*

*[Also, since this is a module we haven't used much--if at all--before, remember to add overview / purpose / who creates / why information.]*
