# Section III Part D: Setting Other SUI Defaults

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

  1. Default note order
  2. Drop down menu default selections (notably for languages)
  3. Default note text

*[...add note re: potential need for users to change their user default settings--e.g. for columns visible when browsing accessions and resource records--since these user settings override the global defaults, and the out of the box settings could be improved. (and have been improved, with the revised global defaults...)]*
