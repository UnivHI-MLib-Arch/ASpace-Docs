# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

Note when searching for archival objects (either in a general search, or in a within-collection search): Compared to our last version of ASpace, 'child of' archival objects no longer automatically count as relevant in searches for queries that include collection-name words, like 'saiki' or 'inouye'.  Instead, the search terms now have to be present in the archival object record itself.  (So, users who were counting a search like 'saiki' to bring up all of the folders in the Saiki collection will now have to find a workaround...)
