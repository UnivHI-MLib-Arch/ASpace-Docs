# Placeholder for documentation on UHM-Library's ASpace upgrade worfklow(s)

Notes / Considerations / To-Dos:

- This will probably need to be expanded into a folder, to contain, e.g.: a generic upgrade workflow, proposed / customized workflows for specific upgrades, list(s) of helpful resources, and so on.
- Probably would be good to have more than one version of a generic workflow: at least a high-level summary and a more detailed step-by-step process guide.

Sections / Chapters / Documents (depending on how things end up being organized):

- Logistics
  - Cadence(s)
    - Upgrades (i.e. updating to latest ASpace version number)
    - Non-upgrade improvements (i.e. adding functionality, increasing useability, etc.)
  - Communication needs
    - Core team: Faculty ASpace maintainer + DNS sysdmin
    - CDMC Archives Subcommittee
- Big picture view of an upgrade process
- Detailed view
- Things to be sure to remember
