# Placeholder for documentation on UHM-Library's ASpace upgrade worfklow(s)

Notes / Considerations / To-Dos:

- This will probably need to be expanded into a folder, to contain, e.g.: a generic upgrade workflow, proposed / customized workflows for specific upgrades, list(s) of helpful resources, and so on.
- Probably would be good to have more than one version of a generic workflow: at least a high-level summary and a more detailed step-by-step process guide.
