# Documentation for UHML's ArchivesSpace implementation(s)

- Staff_User_Manual: Information about using ArchivesSpace for UHML staff
  - User manual
  - User manual, alternate formats (same content as above repackaged, e.g. for a libguide or wiki)
- Upgade_History: Past, present, and projected future of UHML's ArchivesSpace development
  - Chronology of and release notes for past version upgrades and feature improvements
  - Development roadmap: Desired, upcoming, or otherwise potential feature improvements to make the best use of the current ASpace version (i.e. not specifically tied to a version upgrade)
- Workflow_Manual: Information about upgrading ArchivesSpace for UHML ArchivesSpace sysadmins
  - Logistics
  - Workflows  

To consider: Add a guide / help page / portal for PUI end-users (i.e. researchers)?  (And if so, should that be integrated into the ASpace PUI itself--and thus part of our main AS code repository--or should it be packaged as something like a LibGuide, and thus live here in the docs repo?)
