# Documentation for UHML's ArchivesSpace implementation(s)

- [Staff_User_Manual](https://github.com/UnivHI-MLib-Arch/ASpace-Docs/blob/main/Staff_User_Manual/README.md): Information about using ArchivesSpace for UHML staff
- [Upgade_History](https://github.com/UnivHI-MLib-Arch/ASpace-Docs/blob/main/Upgrade_History/README.md): Past, present, and projected future of UHML's ArchivesSpace development
- [Workflow_Manual](https://github.com/UnivHI-MLib-Arch/ASpace-Docs/blob/main/Workflow_Manual/README.md): Information for UHML ArchivesSpace sysadmins about the process of upgrading ArchivesSpace

To consider: Add a guide / help page / portal for PUI end-users (i.e. researchers)?  (And if so, should that be integrated into the ASpace PUI itself--and thus part of our main AS code repository--or should it be packaged as something like a wiki or a LibGuide, and thus live here in the docs repo?)
