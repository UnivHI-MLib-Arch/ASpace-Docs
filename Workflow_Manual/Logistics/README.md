# ASpace Upgrade Workflow Logistics Overview

- Who: **Stakeholders**
  - Core Team (i.e. the Faculty ASpace maintainer + the DNS sysdmin)
  - CDMC Archives Subcommittee
  - Other UHML ASpace SUI users
  - Researchers and other UHML ASpace PUI users
- What: **Types of projects**
  - Version Upgrades (i.e. updating to a more recent ASpace version number)
  - Feature Upgrades (i.e. adding functionality to and increasing the useability of our current version)
  - Non-upgrade improvements (i.e. other projects to support our use of ASpace)
    - Documentation Reviews / Rewrites / Improvements (e.g. checking links, adding info in additional formats such as screen shots or video snippets, repackaging for other platforms, etc.)
    - ASpace Data Cleanup Projects (e.g. adding normalized versions of date expressions, reparative description, container barcoding, fixing containers from original migration where both folders and boxes were listed as top containers, adding filing titles to resource records where the first word of the collection title is someone's given name, etc.)
- When: **Cadences**
  - Biennial cycle: Version upgrades and Feature upgrades in alternating years
  - Triennial cycle: Version upgrade, Feature upgrade, Non-upgrade improvement project
  - How to choose between the two: The triennial cycle is the default, but it may be converted to a biennial cycle--i.e. the feature upgrade year may be switched to a non-upgrade improvement year, or the non-upgrade improvement year may be skipped--if ArchivesSpace releases one or more new versions with major bugfixes, functionality improvements, etc.
  - In either case, each 'year' in the cycle runs September-August: (also see the workflows themselves for more details)
    - For version and/or feature upgrade years:
      - September-December: background research / drafting (or fixing) code / sandboxing and unit tests / etc.
      - January-April: putting it all together and exploring the impact of new changes on a test server with real data
      - May-August: performing the production server upgrade / documentating the work / training and outreach
    - For non-upgrade improvement years:
      - September-October: scoping the project(s) and doing preliminary groundwork
      - November-June: working on the project(s)
      - July-August: preparing deliverables / documenting the work / training and outreach
