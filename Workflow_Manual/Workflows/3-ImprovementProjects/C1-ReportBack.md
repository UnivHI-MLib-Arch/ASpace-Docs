# Improvement Project Process: Section C Part 1: Report Back Out

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

- July (more or less; some work will have started in June, and aim to finish in the third week or so)
  - Note overlap with C2

## Tasks

- draft (and/or compile) summary / year-end report
  - consider including any documents/templates/survey forms/etc. created for use in the project as appendices ...
- present report at archives subcommittee meeting
- send short version to library as a whole (either email or as a weekly update submission)
  - maybe also let everyone know if/when/that documentation has been updated (or maybe do this in steps C2 or C3)
