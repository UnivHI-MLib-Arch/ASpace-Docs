# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

## Timing

- Training / Outreach for UHML staff, volunteers, student assistants, etc. who use the ASpace SUI and/or who use the PUI to assist in responding to reference inquiries: First two or three weeks of August
- Training / Outreach for other UHM students + faculty: Late August, i.e. after the new school year has started (circa August 20th - 31st)

## Tasks

[... the actual need for formal trainings may depend on whether there's been enough of a change from the pre-upgrade version to be necessary, but then again--given turnover, etc.--it might be worthwhile to plan for periodic trainings regardless of the amount/degree of change from the last version...]

- Also note potential need to email lib_ids to let folks know that the documentation has been updated [if not already done in steps C1 or C2]
