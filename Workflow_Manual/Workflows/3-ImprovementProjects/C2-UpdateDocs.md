# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

## Timing

- July (more or less; some work will have started in the 'B' steps)
  - Note overlap with C1

## Tasks

... make sure codebase repo is up to date (e.g. any new templates / scripts / forms / etc. added in new subfolder); update or draft new change log / release notes (and rotate the previous one out if a brand new one is created); if needed update development roadmap (and rotate it if updated); update staff local practice guide (e.g. to let staff know how to use a field to prevent re-occurrence of messy data); if needed update workflow process manual; etc. ...

- may also be a good idea to email lib_ids to let folks know that the documentation has been updated, but this task might properly belong in step C1 or in step C3, not here
