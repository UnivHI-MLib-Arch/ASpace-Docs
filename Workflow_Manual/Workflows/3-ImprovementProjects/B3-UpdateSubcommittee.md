# Improvement Project Process: Section B Part 3: Keep Stakeholders Updated

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

- Ordinary updates: November - May (more or less; note significant overlap with B1 and B2: documentation and communication should be happening alongside the project work)
- Looking forward and starting to prepare for final report: June

## Tasks

- keep in touch w/Archives Subcommittee! (especially if work on projects is distributed among multiple staff...)
- also consider other stakeholders who may be interested in and/or affected by the work: e.g. Library IT (including network/server admins, Digital Preservation Librarian, et al.), students/volunteers who actively use ASpace, and so on
