# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

## Timing

October (more or less)

## Tasks

- for each project selected in step A1, create a project plan that includes
  - purpose / scope / desired outcome
  - goals/metrics for completion
  - tentative timeline
  - if multiple projects chosen, also note how they interact w/each other (e.g. dependencies and/or synergies, if any), and also a prioritized/ranking of their order of importance in case any end up needing to be dropped
    - [this might take the form of an overall plan for the year, w/summaries for the individual projects and a combined timeline, etc.]
