# Version Upgrade Process: Section A Part 1: Background Research and other Preparation

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

September (more or less)

## Tasks

- work w/archives subcommittee to vet/approve short list of the year's propsed projects
- Review current development roadmap for any notes on proposed target version
- Review the config.rb file[s] for the target ASpace version and any/all versions in between it and the current production version
  - Full set [on GitHub here](https://github.com/archivesspace/archivesspace/blob/master/common/config/config-defaults.rb); click on “tags” button to search for / display config file(s) for specific version(s)
  - Also look at the current local version [in the UHML ASpace code repo](https://github.com/UnivHI-MLib-Arch/ASpace)
- It's a good idea to review the ASpace tech docs more generally, too...
- Also, check to see whether any plugins in use in production have been upgraded as a result of new versions having come out...

- start thinking about potential specific timeline for the upgrade (i.e. more specific than "May-August of the coming year")
