# Version Upgrade Process: Section A Part 3: Draft Potential Updates to Presumably-Affected Code

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

Late October - November (more or less; aim for last week of October - Thanksgiving)

## Tasks

- ... based on sandbox testdrive, start drafting lists (and/or code, if needed) of things that will likely need to be updated in order for the upgrade to go smoothly.  
  - (e.g. config file settings, in-SUI settings, plugins that need to be updated as a result of the AS version change, database migrations/record structure changes, possibly also workflows like printing or running reports, etc.)
- This would also be a good time to create one (or more) new branch[es] in the git/github repos...
