# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

## Timing

Mid March - Late April (more or less; specifcally aim for March 16th - April 20th)

## Tasks

Non-comprehensive list of things that have been 'gotchas' in the past:

- location records
- solr config settings
- reindexing (and potentially choosing not to reindex the PUI during some types of testing)
