# Version Upgrade Process: Section C Part 4: Inspect Upgraded Production Instance

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

Mid June - Early July (more or less, aim to do this roughly June 16th - July 10th)

## Tasks

- Invite Archives Subcommittee to help 'kick the tires' as it were...
- [See Testing Protocol document; decide whether to insert entire doc here (or simply upload it as a separate file) or to instead parse it out into specific sub-sections and only include most relevant items at this stage]
- *[among items to include in testing protocol, and here: if/when testing things in the SUI, login as users with differing permissions levels (i.e. students and normal staff with lower permissions)]*
- *[copy and generalize timeline portion of the 'Embargo Emails' document, specifically the section that details lifting the embargo on the production server.  Also upload (as separate file) document with sample versions of the various embargo-related emails]*
