# Version Upgrade Process: Section B Part 3: Thorough Testing in/of Test Instance of Target Version

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

Late February - Mid March (more or less; specifcally aim for Presidents' Day - March 15th)

## Tasks

- *[See (and/or upload) draft testing protocol document; decide whether to insert entire doc here or to instead parse it out into specific sub-sections and only include most relevant items at this stage]*
- *[among items to include in protocol, and here: if/when testing things in the SUI, login as users with differing permissions levels (i.e. students and normal staff with lower permissions)]*
