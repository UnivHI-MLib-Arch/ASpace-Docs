# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

## Timing

- Communication regarding the upcoming embargo: early May (more or less; specifcally aim for the first two weeks of the month)
- Embargo itself: Mid May - Mid July (potentially, but may be a shorter duration, depending on how long steps C2-C4 take)
- NB: Embargo should not start until after the end of the Spring term! (Usually mid-May[ish], but always double-check the specific date; ideally the embargo should start towards the beginning of the interim week between the Spring term and Summer Session I.)

## Tasks

- *[copy and generalize timeline portion of the 'Embargo Emails' document; also upload (as separate file) document with sample versions of the various embargo-related emails]*
- *[Also note: It's may be a good idea to place a notice about the embargo + upgrade somewhere on the ASpace PUI itself to give users from outside the Library notice of the process as well...]*
