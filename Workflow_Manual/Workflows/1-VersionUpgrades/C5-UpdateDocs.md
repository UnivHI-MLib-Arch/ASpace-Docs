# Version Upgrade Process: Section C Part 5: Update Documentation

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

Mid July - Early August (more or less, aim to do this roughly July 10th - August 10th)

## Tasks

... [ make sure codebase repo is up to date [double check work done in step B5]; draft new change log / release notes and then rotate the previous one out; if needed update development roadmap (and rotate it if updated); update staff local practice guide; if needed update workflow process manual; etc. ... ]

- should also email lib_ids to let folks know that the documentation has been updated, but that task might properly belong in step C6, not here
