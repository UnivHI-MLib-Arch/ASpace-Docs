# Version Upgrade Process: Section A Part 2: Test Driving a Sandbox of the Target Version

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

October (more or less; aim for first three weeks of October)

## Tasks

- Try out a sandbox version ... (if can; might not be able to if the target version isn't the current version...)
  - NB: include / annotate a link on where to find official AS sandbox / test version
  - ...alternately, instructions on how to determine what AS version other institutions are using (which will at least give some sense of the PUI, although it won't help for the SUI, or help distinguish what in their PUI is due to the underlying core code and what is the result of their local plugins/config settings/etc.)
- [See Testing Protocol document; decide whether to insert entire doc here or to instead parse it out into specific sub-sections and only include most relevant items at this stage]
