  - ...for a version upgrade
  - ...for an improvement upgrade
  - Include flowchart(s) / workflow diagram(s)?
- Detailed view(s)
  - (step-by-step instructions for each, but need to decide just how granular to be)
- Things to be sure to remember (e.g. places in the application structure to check for customizations/changes)
