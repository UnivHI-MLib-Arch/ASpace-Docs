# UHML ASpace Upgrade Workflows - Overview

Note: Eventually, this will be a table of contents, with each list item linking to a detailed workflow for that process/sub-task.

## Version Upgrades

### A) September-December: background research / sandboxing and unit tests / etc

1. Preparation / background research
2. Test drive in sandbox
3. Pre-emptive (draft) updates to affected plugins, config settings, workflows, etc.
4. Pre-upgrade data cleanup and low-level testing

### B) January-April: putting it all together and exploring the impact of new changes on a test server with real data

1. Data capture from production and creation of test instance of new version
2. Refine / solidify updates to affected plugins, config settings, workflows, etc.
3. Thorough testing; troubleshooting
4. Review of likely known issues (troublespots from past upgrades)
5. Ensure GitHub codebase repo is up to date (merge branch initially created in step A.3.)

### C) May-August: performing the production server upgrade / documentating the work / training and outreach

1. Embargo production server
2. Data capture from production and creation of production instance of new version
3. Apply local updates from step B to production server
4. Inspect new version
5. Documentation: update GitHub docs repo (Staff Manual, Update Chronology, Release Notes, and Workflow Guide)
