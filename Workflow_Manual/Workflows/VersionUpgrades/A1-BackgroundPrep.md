- Review config.rb file[s] for the target ASpace version and for any/all versions in between it and the current production version
  - Full set [on GitHub](https://github.com/archivesspace/archivesspace/blob/master/common/config/config-defaults.rb); click on “tags” button to search for / display config file(s) for specific version(s)
  - It's a good idea to review the ASpace tech docs more generally, too...
