# Feature Upgrade Process: Section A Part 2: Test Driving a Sandbox of the Target Version

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

Early October - Mid November (more or less; roughly Oct 8th - Nov 15th)

## Tasks

- If possible, see how potential changes work in other institutions and/or in the official ASpace sandbox...
  - But note: this may not be possible...in that case, omit this step and move on to A4!
- [See Testing Protocol document; decide whether to insert entire doc here or to instead parse it out into specific sub-sections and only include most relevant items at this stage (or simply upload it as a separate file)]
