# Feature Upgrade Process: Section B Part 4: Ensure Any/All CodeBase Repositories are Up To Date

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

Late April (more or less; roughly the 15th - 30th)

## Tasks

- Reintegrate (i.e. push / merge) any and all branch[es] inititally created in step A2 to the remote github repository *[q.v / link here]* and on local machines in preparation for production instance upgrade ...delete side branch[es] when done merging

- *[also figure out / determine: how is this step different from the parallel step in a version upgrade?]*
