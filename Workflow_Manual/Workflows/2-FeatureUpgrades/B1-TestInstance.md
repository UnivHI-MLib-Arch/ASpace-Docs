# Feature Upgrade Process: Section B Part 1: Capture Data from Production and Create Test Instance (or Update Test Instance with Latest Data If It Already Exists)

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

1st half of January (more or less; aim to have instance up and running by MLK day)

## Tasks

- *[NB: need to complete and then upload the draft testing protocol, and/or excerpt relevant sections here.]*
- *[also figure out / determine: how is this step different from the parallel step in a version upgrade?]*
