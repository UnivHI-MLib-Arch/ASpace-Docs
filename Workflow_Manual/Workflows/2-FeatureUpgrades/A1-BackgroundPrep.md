# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

- Scan GitHub repos / wikis / etc from other institutions to identify new / updated plugins, etc.
  - [determine cadence: quarterly is likely too often; maybe at start and end of each feature project year/cycle?  Or should this only happen at the end of the year, as part of the 'C4-UpdateDocs' step?]
- Review roadmap
- Select issues / features to work on
- Background research [e.g. review ASpace tech docs, any plugin documentation, and so on...]
