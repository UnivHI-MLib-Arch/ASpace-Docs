# Feature Upgrade Process: Section A Part 1: Background Research and other Preparation

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

September (more or less)

## Tasks

- Scan GitHub repos / wikis / etc from other institutions to identify new / updated plugins, etc.
  - [determine cadence: quarterly is likely too often; maybe at start and end of each feature project year/cycle?  Or should this only happen at the end of the year, as part of the 'C4-UpdateDocs' step?]
- Review current development roadmap as well as list of known issues from the previous upgrade for potential projects
- Also look at technical documentation for any new plugins under consideration
- If any changes require changes to the config file, it's a good idea to review the config file defaults--[the full set is on GitHub here](https://github.com/archivesspace/archivesspace/blob/master/common/config/config-defaults.rb); click on “tags” button to search for / display config file(s) for specific version(s)--as well as the current local version [in the UHML ASpace code repo](https://github.com/UnivHI-MLib-Arch/ASpace)
  - It's also a good idea to review the ASpace tech docs more generally, too...
- work w/archives subcommittee to vet/approve short list of the year's propsed projects
  - Select issues / features to work on

- start thinking about potential specific timeline for the upgrade (i.e. more specific than "May-August of the coming year")
