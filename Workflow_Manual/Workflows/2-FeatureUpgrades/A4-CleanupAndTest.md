# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

## Timing

Mid November - December (more or less; aim for November 16th - Christmas break)

## Tasks

- Cleanup production data if/as needed...
  - also note need to communicate w/Archives Subcommittee about what data is being altered and why...
- Low-level tests [See Testing Protocol document; decide whether to insert entire doc here or to instead parse it out into specific sub-sections and only include most relevant items at this stage (or simply upload it as a separate file)]
