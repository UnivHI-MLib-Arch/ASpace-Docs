# Version Upgrade Process: Section C Part 5: Training and Outreach for New ASpace Features

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

- Training / Outreach for UHML staff, volunteers, student assistants, etc. using ASpace SUI and/or using the PUI to assist in responding to reference inquiries: Mid August (circa Aug 10th - 20th)
- Training / Outreach for UHM (non-Library) students + faculty: Late August (circa August 20th - 31st)

## Tasks

[... the actual need for formal trainings may depend on whether there's been enough of a change from the pre-upgrade version to be necessary, but then again--given turnover, etc.--it might be worthwhile to plan for periodic trainings regardless of the amount/degree of change from the last version...]

- Also note potential need to email lib_ids to let folks know that the documentation has been updated [if not already done in step C4]

- *[also figure out / determine: how is this step different from the parallel step in a version upgrade?]*
