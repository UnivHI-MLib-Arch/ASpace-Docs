# Feature Upgrade Process: Section B Part 2: Refine / Solidify Updates to Plugins, Settings, Workflows, Etc.

**[incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]**

## Timing

Mid January - February (more or less; roughly aim for MLK Day - February 28th)

## Tasks

- try out the potential/likely/necessary updates on our test instance, and refine as needed to get into a testable state...
- *[also figure out / determine: how is this step different from the parallel step in a version upgrade?]*
