# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

- Invite Archives Subcommittee to help 'kick the tires' as it were...
- [See Testing Protocol document; decide whether to insert entire doc here or to instead parse it out into specific sub-sections and only include most relevant items at this stage (or simply upload it as a separate file)]
- *[among items to include in the testing protocol, as well as here: if/when testing things in the SUI, login as users with differing permissions levels (i.e. students and normal staff with lower permissions)]*
- *[copy and generalize timeline portion of the 'Embargo Emails' document (specifically the section that details lifting the embargo on the production server).  Also upload (as a separate file) a document with sample versions of the various embargo-related emails]*
