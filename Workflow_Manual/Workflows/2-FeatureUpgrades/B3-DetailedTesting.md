# [incomplete draft outline; what steps are present are not necessarily in order]

## Timing

March - mid April (more or less; aim to be finished by 4/15)

## Tasks

- [See Testing Protocol document; decide whether to insert entire doc here or to instead parse it out into specific sub-sections and only include most relevant items at this stage (or simply upload it as a separate file)]
- *[among items to include in the testing protocol, as well as here: if/when testing things in the SUI, login as users with differing permissions levels (i.e. students and normal staff with lower permissions)]*
- *[also figure out / determine: how is this step different from the parallel step in a version upgrade?]*
