  - Communication needs [This section should be moved to / subsumed within the workflows themselves]

    - Other (e.g. communications to all UHML AS staff users; to all UHML PSD staff; to researchers; etc.)
- Workflows
  - Big picture view of a generic upgrade/improvement process
  - Detailed view(s)
  - Things to be sure to remember (e.g. places in the application structure to check for customizations/changes)

## Decision(s) to make / things to do

- Organization for the workflows themselves, i.e. should the 2nd-level folders be 'generic upgrade processes' and 'detailed views' or should they be 'version upgrade' and 'feature upgrade'?
- Need to make sure to include communications + memoranda in the various workflows, and then delete them from outline above once that's been done.
