# Placeholder for information about the past and future of UHML's ASpace implementation

File index / document outline (depending on how things end up being organized once this placeholder is fleshed out and then potentially expanded into separate documents):

- Past: Chronology of ASpace versions in use at UHML
- Present:
  - Production: Pointer to Staff_User_Manual folder for current release notes and user guide(s)
  - Test: Info about what is being worked on for the next/upcoming upgrade (i.e. whether it's a feature upgrade or a version upgrade, estimated timeline for deployment to production, etc.)
- Future: Development roadmap for future version and feature upgrades
