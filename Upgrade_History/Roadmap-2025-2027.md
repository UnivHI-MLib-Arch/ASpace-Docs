# Tentative roadmap for UHML ASpace development for 2025-2027

(See the Chronology document for work that has been done until now)

- 2025: Feature upgrade - Address punchlist items from 2024 upgrades:
  - Improve solr search result set ordering
  - Figure out and resolve issues with UHML logo in PUI (placement and lack of link)
  - Bring select handful of other issues / potential improvements to Archives Subcommittee for prioritization
- 2026: Non-upgrade improvements - some combination of the following:
  - Add finding aid filing titles to all resource records with someone's given name as the first word in the title
  - Language of materials review (double-check with selectors on languages that look like they might have been mistakenly selected from the drop-down controlled value menu, e.g. should "Castillian Spanish" be simply "Spanish", or do some records list "Elamite" as the language because it is the value next to "English" in the menu, and so on)
  - Re-standardize / fix formatting of stray accession numbers and collection IDs
  - Analyze ASpace data (i.e. run various reports) to identify key issues, establish baseline metrics, and make a list of future tasks to bring to the Archives Subcommittee for prioritization
- 2027: Version upgrade:
  - Upgrade ASpace version from v.3.4.1 to whatever is current/stable at the time (i.e. NOT an X.x.0 release)
